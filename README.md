## Installation

To create this site, we first had to create a working search bar and an accompanying search button.
Then we had to create an onclick function in our Javascript that would call information from our api(s)

## Usage

The website updates in real time with the total number of U.S. COVID-19 cases directly on the UI of the html.
To find out the information of different states in the U.S., simply type the name of the state within the search box, making sure to start the state name with a capital letter (ex: CORRECT = "Texas"; INCORRECT = "texas").
After doing so, the data about the searched state should render onto the html just under the present data.

## Credits

The api used for total USA data is from [Postman: COVID19 API](https://api.covid19api.com/)

The api used for individual state data is from a fellow developer Ted Slesinkski:

We would also like to credit the help of the Stack OverFlow community

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them.
